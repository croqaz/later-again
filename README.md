# Later-again ⏰

  [![Standard Style Guide][style-img]][style-url]

When I discovered the original [Later.js](https://github.com/bunkat/later) library, I was in awe. This is probably the best recurring schedules and calculating calendar occurrences ever. At least in the Node.js ecosystem.
The amount of work refining this is incredible...
Also, I felt like discovering ancient aliens, because the original library is pretty old, in Node.js years...

So, thank you [Bill BunKat](https://github.com/bunkat)!

This repository tries to continue the work of the original library, using newer ES5+ features. Also, I'm doing my best to fix some of the old bugs, or add some missing features. Feel free to contribute!
