When I discovered the original [Later.js](https://github.com/bunkat/later) library, I was in awe, like I've just discovered an ancient treasure. This is probably the best recurring schedules and calculating calendar occurrences ever. At least in the Node.js ecosystem.
The amount of work refining this is incredible...

So, thank you [Bill BunKat](https://github.com/bunkat) and contributors!

This repository tries to continue the work of the original library, using newer ES5+ features. Also, I'm doing my best to fix some of the old bugs, or add some missing features. Feel free to contribute!

## Installation

Simply install with npm:

> $ npm install later-again

The rest documentation can still be found in the old repository: https://bunkat.github.io/later
